# Introduction

## General notation and abbreviations

-   iid: independent and identically distributed
-   pdf: probability density function
-   $N_2$: Bivariate cumulative Gaussian distribution function
-   $\phi$: Probability density function of the standard Gaussian distribution
-   $\Phi$: Cumulative distribution function of the standard Gaussian distribution
-   $\Phi^{-1}$: Quantile function of the standard Gaussian distribution function

## 'Power' vocabulary

In their supplement Kunzmann et al. @Kunzmann2022 provide a literature review of the terminology used in articles. We provide here a summary of this terminology:

-   **Frequentist power**: Probability of rejection given that the alternative hypothesis is true.
-   **Average power**: Prior averaged probability of rejection. Often also called 'probability of success', 'assurance', 'Bayesian predictive power'.
-   **Prior adjusted power**: Joint probability of rejection and that the treatment effect is effective.

## Some 'Bayesian' concepts

- **Design prior**: Priors used before data collection as data generating mode @Stefan2019.
- **Analysis prior**: Priors used for Bayesian analysis of the collected data @Stefan2019.
- **Prior predictive distribution**: Situation *before* a sample was taken. Let $\theta$ be a realisation of a random variable $\Theta$ with pdf $p(\theta)$. Then for a future observation $\tilde X$

$$
p(\tilde x)=\int_\Theta p(\tilde x, \theta)d\theta=\int_\Theta \underbrace{p(\tilde x | \theta)}_{likelihood}\underbrace{p(\theta)}_{prior}d\theta
$$

-   **Posterior predictive distribution**: Situation *after* a sample was taken. Let $\theta$ be a realisation of a random variable $\Theta$ with pdf $p(\theta)$. Then for a future observation $\tilde X$ and observed $X$ (since $X$ is independent $\tilde X$)

$$
p(\tilde x|x)=\int_\Theta p(\tilde x | \theta, x)p(\theta|x)d\theta=\int_\Theta \underbrace{p(\tilde x | \theta)}_{likelihood}\underbrace{p(\theta|x)}_{prior}d\theta.
